# FlexVision üåü  
**Real-Time Human Pose Estimatior and Custom Pose Classifier**

FlexVision is an interactive web-based application that combines computer vision and machine learning to estimate and classify human poses in real-time. Built using **Mediapipe**, **Flask**, and **OpenCV**, it empowers users to monitor movements, ensure correct posture, and even create custom pose models for specific applications.

## Features üöÄ  

- **Real-Time Pose Estimation**:  
  Detect and analyze human poses using Mediapipe's efficient pose detection module.  

- **Custom Pose Classification**:  
  Add and train custom poses with an intuitive interface, enabling the model to recognize user-specific movements.  

- **Live Feedback**:  
  Get confidence scores and visual feedback for every detected pose on the video feed.  

- **Lightweight and Accessible**:  
  Runs efficiently on low-resource devices without requiring GPUs.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Capture Live Feed  
FlexVision uses your webcam to capture real-time video and extract skeletal landmarks.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detect and Classify Poses  
Using a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model, FlexVision matches live inputs with stored poses and provides classification results.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Custom Poses  
Easily store your own poses via the **Add Pose** feature, creating a personalized library of movements.

# Note:
### Add poses of your choice to create a pickle file before starting 'Detection'
### To check stored poses refer to check_pose.py
